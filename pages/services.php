                            <p>Downloading data for developer logs or traces would involve retrieving the recorded information about events that have occurred within a software application, system, or network. This data can help developers analyze and troubleshoot issues, monitor performance metrics, and improve overall system reliability. The specific process for downloading developer logs or traces may vary depending on the software or system being used.</p>

                                Logs are data files that contain recorded events or messages that occurred in a computer system or application. The /var/log directory is a common location for system logs in Unix and Linux operating systems. Logs are often used to debug problems, analyze performance, and audit user activities.

                                Traces refer to a type of log that captures detailed information about a specific process or transaction in an application. Traces are often used to diagnose issues with code, identify performance bottlenecks, and improve overall system efficiency. /temp/.json is a file format commonly used for storing trace data.

                                In summary, logs and traces are important tools for system administrators and developers to monitor and optimize computer systems and applications.

                            <p>Note: A Dream Machine (UDM) or Dream Machine Pro (UDM Pro), and at least one Unifi Access Point (UAP) is required to create a UID WiFi network. 
                                <br>
                            UID WiFi is automatically deployed after installing the UID Agent application on your UniFi OS Console.
                                <br><pre>
                            If the automatic deployment is disabled, configure UID WiFi manually:

                            1. Select the site from the drop-down field at the top-left corner of the screen to access its dashboard. 
                            2. Select One-click WiFi in the Services section.
                            3. Set the WiFi network’s name (Workspace SSID) along with other UID WiFi settings.
                        </pre>

                            Note: These can be edited later in the workspace’s Settings > Advanced > WiFi menu.
                            Set up a VLAN network by clicking the drop-down window to display the existing VLANs in the 
                            network application, or click New VLAN to create a new one.
                            Note: Ipv6 for Network is not supported at the moment.</p>
